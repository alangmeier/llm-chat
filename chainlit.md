# 
# 📣 Welcome to your personal AI chat assistant ! 📣

Hello everyone ! 👐

I am thrilled to have you here and I hope you'll enjoy your time with this AI chatbot. 🤖 
Feel free to converse with the model and test its limitations. 💬

This project does not intend to implement extra-accurate, state of the art LLM models. To this end, I'll guide you towards [more well-known and established platforms](https://chat.openai.com/).
In the end, it's just for fun ! 💥
More improvements may be implemented in the future. 🔜
If you feel *adventurous*, you can try using other models. The procedure for loading other models is explained [here](https://github.com/alangmeier/llm-chat/blob/main/models/README.md). 📚

If you like this project, don't hesitate to give support or contribute to [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/alangmeier/llm-chat) ! 📌

## ❤️ Thanks and have fun ! ❤️
